2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
ThePhoneHub.in is a greenfield standalone platform using a decoupled architecture. The React.js SPA (Vite dev server on localhost:5173) acts as the presentation layer and the PHP 8.2 Laravel 11 RESTful API (php artisan serve on localhost:8000) acts as the application and business logic layer. MySQL 8.0 (bundled in XAMPP / Laragon) is the data layer. The React frontend communicates with the PHP API over HTTP on localhost during development. All external service calls — Razorpay, MSG91, SendGrid, Shiprocket — use test/sandbox keys locally and log to the Laravel log file.

2.2 Product Features Summary

User Authentication	Registration, Login, OTP, JWT sessions, Password Reset	High
Product Catalog	Grid listing, Multi-filter, MySQL FULLTEXT Search, Condition Grading	High
Product Detail Page	Image gallery, Specs, Warranty info, Pincode checker, Variants	High
Shopping Cart	Add/Remove, Persistent cart, Coupon codes, Price summary	High
Checkout	Address, Pincode validation, Razorpay payment, Order confirmation	High
Order Management	Order history, Real-time status timeline, GST Invoice PDF	High
Admin Panel	Inventory CRUD, Order processing, Coupons, Sales reports	High
Warranty Module	Auto-registration on delivery, Claim submission, Status tracking	Medium
Notifications	Email (SMTP/SendGrid), SMS (MSG91), WhatsApp (logged locally)	Medium
Customer Support	FAQ pages, Contact form, Ticket system	Medium
SEO & Marketing	React Helmet meta tags, Sitemap, Coupon codes, Banners	Medium
Analytics	Traffic, Sales funnel, Abandoned cart reports	Low

Supported Browsers	Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
•	The entire platform must run on localhost using XAMPP or Laragon with zero cloud or Docker dependency during development.
•	React frontend (Vite) on localhost:5173; Laravel API on localhost:8000. Laravel CORS middleware configured to allow origin http://localhost:5173.
•	All customer PII encrypted in MySQL using Laravel Crypt facade (AES-256-CBC).
•	GST invoice PDFs generated server-side via barryvdh/laravel-dompdf. No external PDF service required.
•	Product images stored in Laravel storage/app/public and served via php artisan storage:link — no S3 or CDN required locally.
•	Razorpay integrated in test mode locally. No real payments processed during development.
•	All PHP API endpoints versioned under /api/v1/ and auto-documented with Laravel Scribe (php artisan scribe:generate).
•	MySQL schema managed entirely via Laravel migrations — run php artisan migrate to set up the full database in one command.
•	React frontend build output (dist/) is pure static HTML/CSS/JS — deployable to any web host without a Node.js server.

2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
•	Developer machine has XAMPP 8.2 or Laragon 6 installed (includes PHP 8.2, MySQL 8.0, Composer 2).
•	Node.js 20.x and npm 10.x installed separately for React/Vite frontend development.
•	Razorpay test-mode API keys (key_id, key_secret) available in backend .env file.
•	MSG91 and SendGrid integrations use Laravel log mail driver locally — emails appear in storage/logs/laravel.log.
•	Shiprocket API mocked with hardcoded static responses during local testing.
•	Product images provided by content team at minimum 800x800px resolution.
•	Laravel seeders pre-populate MySQL with realistic dummy data for local testing (php artisan db:seed).
 
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 User Authentication & Account Management
3.1.1 User Registration
PHP Laravel API handles OTP generation (stored in MySQL otp_verifications table), JWT issuance, and bcrypt password hashing. React renders forms with client-side Zod validation.

Req ID	Requirement	Priority
AUTH-001	React registration form with fields: Full Name, Mobile Number, Email, Password, Confirm Password. Zod schema validates client-side before API call.	High
AUTH-002	PHP API generates a 6-digit OTP, stores it in otp_verifications MySQL table with a 10-minute expires_at, and sends via MSG91 (logged locally).	High
AUTH-003	OTP expires after 10 minutes. New OTP can be requested after 60 seconds. PHP deletes old OTP on new request.	High
AUTH-004	PHP Laravel Validator enforces: min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character. Returns 422 on failure.	High
AUTH-005	PHP returns 409 if email or mobile already exists in users table (unique index at MySQL level).	High
AUTH-006	On successful registration, PHP dispatches a Laravel queued mail job (database queue driver locally) to send a welcome email.	Medium

•	React Router v6 for client-side routing — no full page reloads.
•	React Helmet Async for dynamic meta tags and page titles per route.
•	Tailwind dark: classes used for dark mode support triggered by OS prefers-color-scheme.
•	Navbar sticky (CSS position: sticky / Tailwind sticky top-0) on all pages with cart icon badge.

4.2 Hardware Interfaces
Web-based platform. No hardware integration required. Local developer machine requirements:
•	Minimum 8GB RAM, dual-core CPU, 20GB free disk space
•	XAMPP 8.2 or Laragon 6 installed and running (Apache/MySQL/PHP)
•	Chrome or Firefox browser with DevTools for debugging React and PHP API

4.3 Software Interfaces
System	Interface / Library	Purpose & Local Behaviour
Razorpay	PHP: razorpay/razorpay SDK; JS: checkout.js CDN	Payment processing. Test-mode keys in .env locally. No real charges.
Shiprocket	PHP: Guzzle HTTP client calling Shiprocket REST API	Shipment + AWB. Returns static mocked JSON responses locally.
MSG91	PHP: Guzzle HTTP calling MSG91 REST API	OTP + SMS. Logged to storage/logs/laravel.log locally.
SendGrid / SMTP	Laravel Mail with log driver locally	Transactional emails. Written to laravel.log. Use real SMTP in production.
India Post Pincodes	MySQL pin_codes table (seeded from India Post data)	Pincode lookup. No external API call needed locally.
WhatsApp Business API	PHP: Guzzle HTTP client	Order notifications. Mocked locally — logged to laravel.log.
Google Analytics 4	gtag.js in React public/index.html	Disabled or pointed to test property during local dev.
Meta Pixel	fbq() script in React public/index.html	Disabled during local development.
Cloudflare CDN	DNS proxy (production only)	Not required in local development.

4.4 Communication Interfaces
•	Local: React (localhost:5173) to Laravel API (localhost:8000) over HTTP. Laravel config/cors.php allows origin http://localhost:5173.
•	All API requests use JSON. Laravel API Resources format all responses with consistent data/meta structure.
•	JWT sent in Authorization: Bearer <token> request header. PHP JWT middleware validates on every protected route.
•	Razorpay webhooks: POST /api/v1/webhooks/razorpay. PHP verifies HMAC-SHA256 signature with webhook secret from .env. Use ngrok locally.
•	Email locally via Laravel log driver — check storage/logs/laravel.log. Production uses SendGrid SMTP with SPF/DKIM/DMARC.
•	All Laravel API errors returned as: { success: false, message: string, errors: {} } JSON.
 
5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Performance Requirements
Metric	Target	How to Measure Locally
Page Load Time (LCP)	< 2.5 seconds	Lighthouse tab in Chrome DevTools
Time to First Byte (TTFB)	< 600ms	Chrome DevTools Network tab — first request
First Input Delay (FID)	< 100ms	Chrome DevTools Performance panel
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)	< 0.1	Lighthouse CLS audit in Chrome DevTools
Checkout Page Load	< 2 seconds	Manual browser timer or Lighthouse
Search API Response	< 300ms from PHP	Laravel Debugbar query log tab
MySQL Query Time	< 100ms P95	Laravel Debugbar — DB queries panel
Vite HMR Dev Reload	< 500ms	Vite terminal output on file save

5.2 Security Requirements
•	Passwords hashed with PHP bcrypt (password_hash + PASSWORD_BCRYPT) at cost factor 12 via Laravel Hash::make().
•	JWT access tokens expire in 15 minutes. Refresh tokens in HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies.
•	Laravel CSRF protection enabled. API routes protected by Laravel Sanctum CSRF cookie or custom X-Requested-With header.
•	All MySQL queries via Laravel Eloquent parameterised bindings. No raw SQL string concatenation.
•	File uploads: PHP validates MIME whitelist (jpeg, png, webp, mp4), max 5MB, stored in non-public storage/app/private/claims.
•	Admin routes protected by auth:jwt + role:admin middleware. Super admin routes require role:superadmin.
•	Rate limiting: Laravel throttle middleware — 10 OTP requests per phone/hour, 100 API calls per IP/minute.
•	PHP sets security headers via middleware: X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, Content-Security-Policy.
•	No card data stored — Razorpay handles all tokenisation. PHP stores only razorpay_order_id and razorpay_payment_id.
•	Customer PII encrypted at rest using Laravel Crypt::encryptString() on sensitive Eloquent model fields.

5.3 Reliability & Availability
Requirement	Target / Local Behaviour

Payment Retry (local)	Razorpay test mode — PHP retries order creation up to 2 times on timeout
Error Monitoring (local)	Laravel Telescope UI at http://localhost:8000/telescope + storage/logs/laravel.log
Queue Worker (local)	Run: php artisan queue:work — processes jobs stored in MySQL jobs table

5.4 Usability Requirements
•	Checkout completable in 5 steps / under 3 minutes by a first-time user (tested locally in Chrome).
•	All form error messages in plain English at a Grade 8 reading level.
•	Target System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 75+ / 100 in user testing sessions.
•	Product search accessible from every React page within 1 click (global navbar search bar).
•	WCAG 2.1 Level AA: all images have alt text, colour contrast >= 4.5:1, full keyboard navigation support.

5.5 Scalability Requirements
•	MySQL schema supports 50,000+ product SKUs via indexes on brand, model, price, condition, stock_qty.
•	Laravel API is stateless (JWT). Horizontally scalable behind a load balancer in production without code changes.
•	React build output (dist/) is pure static files — serves from any web host, Nginx, or CDN in production.
•	Laravel queue (database driver locally, Redis in production) handles notification batch sends of 10,000+ messages asynchronously.

5.6 Maintainability
•	PHP follows PSR-12 coding standard. Enforced by PHP_CodeSniffer (composer run lint).
•	React follows Airbnb ESLint rules. Enforced by ESLint + Prettier on file save in VS Code.
•	All MySQL schema changes made via Laravel migrations. Run php artisan migrate to apply all changes.
•	Laravel seeders provide realistic dummy data: php artisan db:seed — no manual SQL inserts needed.
•	Git version control: all migrations, seeders, .env.example, and README committed. .env files in .gitignore.
•	Laravel Telescope installed locally (php artisan telescope:install) for debugging API requests, DB queries, jobs, and mails.
 
6. System Architecture
6.1 High-Level Architecture — Local Development
ThePhoneHub.in uses a decoupled two-app architecture on localhost. The React Vite SPA (port 5173) is the presentation layer. The Laravel PHP API (port 8000, php artisan serve) is the application and business logic layer. MySQL 8.0 (port 3306, bundled in XAMPP/Laragon) is the data layer. All three run side-by-side on the developer's machine. CORS is configured in Laravel to allow cross-origin requests from port 5173 to port 8000.

6.2 Step-by-Step Local Setup Guide
Step	Command / Action	Notes
1	Install XAMPP 8.2 or Laragon 6	Includes PHP 8.2, MySQL 8.0, Apache. Start MySQL and Apache from control panel.
2	Install Node.js 20.x LTS from nodejs.org	Required only for React/Vite. Includes npm 10.x automatically.
3	Install Composer 2.x from getcomposer.org	PHP dependency manager. Required for Laravel packages.
4	git clone <repo-url> && cd thephonehub	Download all project files from Git repository.
5	cd backend && composer install	Installs Laravel 11 and all PHP packages from composer.json.
6	cp .env.example .env	Create local environment config file from template.
7	php artisan key:generate	Generates APP_KEY in .env for Laravel encryption.
8	Edit .env: DB_HOST=127.0.0.1, DB_DATABASE=thephonehub, DB_USERNAME=root, DB_PASSWORD=	Set MySQL connection. Create the database thephonehub in phpMyAdmin first.
9	php artisan migrate	Runs all Laravel migrations — creates every MySQL table automatically.
10	php artisan db:seed	Seeds MySQL with dummy products, users, categories, and pincodes.
11	php artisan storage:link	Creates symlink public/storage -> storage/app/public for image serving.
12	php artisan telescope:install && php artisan migrate	Installs Laravel Telescope for local debugging. Access at /telescope.
13	php artisan serve	Starts Laravel API at http://localhost:8000. Keep terminal open.
14	Open new terminal: cd ../frontend && npm install	Installs React, Vite, Tailwind, and all JS packages from package.json.
15	cp .env.example .env.local	Create React environment config. Set VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
16	npm run dev	Starts Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173 with hot reload.
17	Open new terminal: cd backend && php artisan queue:work	Runs Laravel queue worker to process email/SMS jobs from MySQL jobs table.
18	Open http://localhost:5173 in Chrome browser	Full platform is now running locally. Admin panel at /admin route.

6.3 Component Architecture
Layer	Component	Technology
Presentation	Customer Storefront (SPA)	React 18 + Vite 5 + React Router v6 + Tailwind CSS
Presentation	Admin Dashboard (SPA)	React 18 + Vite 5 + Tailwind CSS (served at /admin route)
Presentation	Forms & Validation	React Hook Form + Zod schema
Presentation	API Data Fetching & Cache	React Query (TanStack Query v5) + Axios HTTP client
Presentation	Global State (cart/auth)	React Context API + useReducer hook
Presentation	SEO / Meta	React Helmet Async
Application	REST API	PHP 8.2 + Laravel 11 — php artisan serve on localhost:8000
Application	Authentication	tymon/jwt-auth JWT tokens + PHP bcrypt
Application	PDF Generation	barryvdh/laravel-dompdf (invoices, packing slips)
Application	Queue System (local)	Laravel Queue — database driver (jobs in MySQL)
Application	Scheduling (local)	Laravel Scheduler — run manually: php artisan schedule:run
Application	CSV Parsing	league/csv for bulk product CSV upload
Application	External HTTP calls	Guzzle HTTP client (bundled with Laravel)
Application	Debugging & Monitoring	Laravel Telescope + Laravel Debugbar
Data	Primary Database	MySQL 8.0 — accessed via phpMyAdmin at http://localhost/phpmyadmin
Data	File Storage (local)	Laravel storage/app/public — served via storage:link symlink

6.4 Data Flow — Order Processing on Localhost
•	Customer adds product: React updates cart Context. If logged in, calls POST /api/v1/cart/items. PHP writes to cart_items MySQL table.
•	Checkout address: React submits form. PHP calls GET /api/v1/pincodes/{pin} and queries seeded pin_codes MySQL table.
•	Payment initiation: PHP Razorpay SDK creates a test order (razorpay_order_id stored in orders table with status=pending). React opens Razorpay modal.
•	Test payment: use Razorpay test card 4111 1111 1111 1111 CVV 123 any future date. Razorpay returns success callback to React.
•	React calls POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/verify with Razorpay payment_id, order_id, signature for server-side HMAC verification.
•	PHP verifies, sets order status=processing, decrements stock_qty atomically, enqueues email/SMS jobs in MySQL jobs table.
•	Queue worker (php artisan queue:work) processes jobs: emails logged to laravel.log, SMS logged to laravel.log.
•	Admin opens localhost:5173/admin, views order, clicks Create Shipment — PHP returns mocked Shiprocket AWB, stores in orders table.
•	PHP dispatches Shipped notification jobs. Queue worker processes them (logged locally).
•	Admin marks order Delivered — PHP auto-creates warranty record in warranties table (start=today, end=today+6months).

8. Error Handling & Exception Management
8.1 HTTP Error Responses
Laravel's app/Exceptions/Handler.php returns all errors as JSON for API routes. React intercepts via an Axios response interceptor and shows toast notifications or inline field errors.

Code	Scenario	User Message (React)	PHP Action
400	Invalid input / bad request	Please check the highlighted fields and try again.	Laravel Validator returns 400 with errors JSON. React Hook Form maps to field errors.
401	JWT expired or missing	Your session expired. Please log in again.	tymon/jwt-auth middleware returns 401. React clears memory token, redirects to /login.
403	Insufficient role	You do not have permission to do this.	Role middleware returns 403. React shows permission denied message.
404	Product or route not found	We could not find what you are looking for.	Laravel returns 404 JSON. React Router renders custom 404 component.
409	Duplicate order or registration	This looks like a duplicate. Please check My Orders.	PHP checks razorpay_order_id uniqueness. Returns 409 to prevent double processing.
422	Pincode not serviceable or validation error	Delivery not available to this PIN code.	Laravel Validator returns 422 with errors. React displays inline error per field.
429	Rate limit exceeded	Too many requests. Please wait 60 seconds and try again.	Laravel throttle middleware returns 429 with Retry-After header.
500	Unexpected PHP/MySQL error	Something went wrong. Check logs for details.	Laravel logs full stack trace to storage/logs/laravel.log. Telescope shows the error.

8.2 Payment Error Handling
Error Type	Handling Strategy
Razorpay Test Timeout	PHP retries Razorpay order creation up to 2 times with 2-second delay. Order remains in pending status in MySQL.
Card Declined (Test)	Razorpay returns error code. PHP maps to user-friendly message. React shows Retry Payment button.
Duplicate Payment	PHP checks razorpay_order_id in payments table before processing. Returns 409 if duplicate found.
Refund Failure	PHP logs to refunds table with status=failed. Admin sees in Dashboard. Can retry via Razorpay Dashboard.
Webhook Not Received (Local)	Use ngrok (ngrok http 8000) to expose localhost:8000 for Razorpay test webhooks. PHP logs all webhook calls in Telescope.
Queue Job Failure	Laravel logs to failed_jobs MySQL table. Retry all: php artisan queue:retry all. View in Telescope.
